# FAST-LoRa: An Efficient Simulation Framework for Evaluating LoRaWAN Networks and Transmission Parameter Strategies

**FAST-LoRa** is a high-performance, lightweight simulation framework designed for the **fast and accurate evaluation of LoRaWAN networks** and **transmission parameter strategies**. It is tailored for scenarios with **stable traffic patterns** and **uplink-centric communication**, where full discrete-event simulation may be unnecessarily slow or complex.

Instead of relying on packet-level simulation, FAST-LoRa uses **analytical models** and **matrix-based operations** to reduce computational time while preserving strong approximation accuracy.
